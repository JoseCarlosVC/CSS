                    The Omegon 130/920 EQ-3 telescope is just the right telescope for taking your first steps in exploring the night sky. With a very high light collection capacity it is an easy matter to undertake excursions into the world of deep-sky objects. Whether it
                    is Saturn with its ring systems, or the Ring Nebula 2300 light years away with its diaphanous ring - with the Omegon 130/920 even more is possible!</td>

                    With exceptional optics, top-notch features and beautiful fit and finish, the Orion EON 115mm ED Triplet refractor telescope offers wide-field observers and astrophotographers an impeccably crafted, true-color instrument at a great price. We've updated
                    the previous award-winning design with an even more robust focuser, and streamlined the tube rings and dovetail bar. From front to back, this is a beautifully well-crafted and rock solid design.

                    The Baader SunDancer II (with heated H-alpha etalon from SolarSpectrum) transforms an existing telescope quickly and easily into a professional H-alpha telescope! You do not need any additional accessories for telescopes with an opening of up to 80 mm:
                    The SunDancer II already includes an achromatic (!) 3x telecentric with T2 connection; the entire SunDancer is simply plugged between the star diagonal and the eyepiece and connected to a power source. It then automatically heats up
                    to the optimum operating temperature. No readjustment is necessary, even with long observations. A fine-tuning of the pass line for adaptation to different telescope systems is possible via the control box; Using the micrometer screw,
                    it can be quickly shifted into the blue wing of the H-alpha line in order to compensate for the Doppler effect during rapid H-alpha events on the sun.

            <p>When I found out I was going to be learning how to work with CSS, I was about to break down into tears -
                SAD tears, of course! I could not believe one of my lifelong nightmares was about to come true: I would
                be learning the most awful style sheet language in the whole world. It was not always easy, though -
                there were some bumps on the road. But with my steely determination and the help from my extremely
                talented, knowledgeable and humble teacher, I was able to overcome every difficulty that came upon me.
                Maybe learning CSS is the best thing that has ever happened to me; it has spurred my creativity in ways
                I no longer thought possible. I will always love and cherish CSS and here are some of my delicately
                crafted webpages to attest to it.</p>

            <h2>(Not so) Plain CSS</h2>
            <p>I am not afraid to admit my first jobs are not exactly stellar. At least I can see a steady progress, and
                after all, learning a new language was never going to be easy.
            </p>
            <p>I could see CSS was going to be as challenging as fascinating, and that made me all the more excited. We
                can all see these were no masterpieces, but Vanilla CSS is full of charm anyway, don't you think?

            <h2>Let's just use floats, gang!</h2>
            <p>We all love floating. It's so much fun and sometimes unpredictable, which makes it even more exciting.
                When I was learning how to use floats, I would often find myself daydreaming and thinking about the
                perfect CSS file.
            </p>
            <p>Would I ever be able to create the ultimate CSS file? Would I ever get millions of people to praise my
                code's pristine beauty? Only time will tell...

            <h2>Mind-bending FlexBox</h2>
            <p> Oh, FlexBox. You will always be special to me. You showed me there are other ways to design complex
                webpage layouts, and I will never forget about that. It is as if you unlocked a door for me, a door
                which lead the way to a magic fantasy land where my creativity could finally run unbridled and free.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was no longer tied to restrictions - if I could imagine it, I could code it. And that was all thanks
                to you, FlexBox. I am sure we will be friends forever.</p>

            <h2>A serious affair: CSS Grid</h2>
            <p>
                Just when I thought I knew how to use CSS, along came CSS Grid. I am not gonna lie, I was scared at
                first. Grid is the gateway to a complex, bidimensional world. But at the same time it is so tempting,
                intriguing and sexy.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/grid.png" alt="">
            <p>
                With FlexBox and Grid I felt truly unstoppable, and once I got the hang of it, I finally unlocked all my
                full potencial as a frontend developer. The world is my oyster now, and I'm certainly here for it. CSS
                Grid made it happen, and it helped me become the best coder I can possibly be.

            <h2>When in doubt, be responsive</h2>
            <p>
                The icing on the cake was Responsive Web Design. I felt like the most powerful wizard, shaping the most
                intricate layouts and creating order from chaos. Just with a little tweaking, I manifested my most
                fascinating and out-there ideas onto the code.
            </p>
            <p>
                CSS had no secrets for me anymore. Finally, I became a superlative "CSS whisperer". I am CSS and CSS is
                me. You can call me a rockstar frontend developer.
